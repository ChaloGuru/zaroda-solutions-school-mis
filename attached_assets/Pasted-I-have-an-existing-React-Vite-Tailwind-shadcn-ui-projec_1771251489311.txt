I have an existing React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui project with a SuperAdmin and Teacher dashboard already built. I need you to build a complete HOI (Head of Institution) Dashboard and add it to my project. The HOI is the head of the school and manages everything. Here is everything to build:

ROUTE: /hoi-dashboard (already protected by role-based auth)
LAYOUT:
Build a sidebar layout with a top navbar. The sidebar should have collapsible menu sections. Use shadcn/ui components, Tailwind, and lucide-react icons throughout. Store all data in localStorage for now (backend will be added later). Make every section its own page/tab that renders inside the dashboard layout without leaving the page.

SIDEBAR MENU SECTIONS AND FEATURES:
1. Overview (Home)

Stats cards: Total Students, Total Teachers, Total Classes, Total Revenue this month, Attendance rate today
Recent activity feed
Quick action buttons (Add Teacher, Add Student, View Timetable, View Finances)
Announcements panel

2. School Management

Edit school profile (name, logo, address, motto, contacts)
School code display
Academic year and term settings (set current term, start date, end date)
School calendar with events

3. Classes & Streams

View all classes (e.g. Form 1, Form 2, Grade 1 etc.)
Add / edit / delete a class
For each class, add streams (e.g. Form 1 East, Form 1 West)
Assign a class teacher to each stream
View students in each class/stream

4. Teacher Management

Add a teacher manually (name, email, phone, subject specialization, employee ID)
View all teachers in a table with search and filter
Edit or deactivate a teacher
Assign a teacher to a subject + class + stream (e.g. Mr. Oduor → Mathematics → Form 2 East)
View each teacher's full profile: classes they teach, duties, roster, attendance record
Teacher duties: assign duties like gate duty, dining duty, games supervision etc.
Weekly roster: build a weekly duty roster, assign days and duties to teachers, view it in a calendar/table format

5. Student Management

Add a student (name, admission number, class, stream, gender, DOB, parent contact)
View all students with search, filter by class/stream
Edit or transfer a student to another class/stream

Bulk import students (CSV upload UI — just the UI, mark logic as TODO)

6. Officials Management

Add school officials (deputy head, HOD, prefects, etc.)
Assign roles to officials
View all officials in a table

7. Subjects

Add / edit / delete subjects (e.g. Mathematics, English, Kiswahili)
Assign subjects to classes
Link subjects to teachers
View which teacher teaches which subject in which class/stream

8. Timetable

Build a school timetable per class/stream
Each slot has: day, period/time, subject, teacher, room
View timetable as a weekly grid (rows = periods, columns = days)
Filter by class/stream

9. Attendance Summary

View attendance across all classes and streams

15. Settings

Logout button → clears auth and redirects to /login


DATA STORAGE:
Use localStorage for all data with clear key names like zaroda_teachers, zaroda_students, zaroda_classes, zaroda_finances etc. so it's easy to replace with API calls later.
Create a src/lib/storage.ts utility file with helper functions:

getData(key) → parse from localStorage
setData(key, data) → stringify to localStorage
addItem(key, item) → add to an array in localStorage
updateItem(key, id, updates) → update one item by id
deleteItem(key, id) → remove one item by id

Every item stored should have a unique id (use crypto.randomUUID()).

FILE STRUCTURE:
src/pages/hoi/
  HoiDashboard.tsx          ← main layout with sidebar
  HoiOverview.tsx
  HoiSchool.tsx
  HoiClasses.tsx
  HoiTeachers.tsx
  HoiStudents.tsx
  HoiOfficials.tsx
  HoiSubjects.tsx
  HoiTimetable.tsx
  HoiAttendance.tsx
  HoiFinances.tsx
  HoiLibrary.tsx
  HoiSports.tsx
  HoiElections.tsx
  HoiReports.tsx
  HoiSettings.tsx
src/lib/storage.ts

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT touch the SuperAdmin or Teacher dashboards already built
Do NOT remove or change the auth system already in place
HOI route /hoi-dashboard must remain protected (only role=HOI can access)
Use the same design language (shadcn/ui, Tailwind, lucide-react) already used in the project
Make all tables have pagination (10 rows per page)
All forms must have validation and show error messages
All add/edit actions open in a modal/dialog, not a new page
Use recharts for all charts (already likely installed)
