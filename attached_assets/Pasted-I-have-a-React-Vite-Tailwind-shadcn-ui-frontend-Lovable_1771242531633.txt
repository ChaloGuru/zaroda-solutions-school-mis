I have a React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui frontend (Lovable-built) with a login page already designed. I need you to build a complete authentication system with role-based routing. No Supabase — use React Context + localStorage for now.
Roles and dashboards needed:

superadmin → /superadmin-dashboard (already built)
teacher → /teacher-dashboard (already built)
HOI → /hoi-dashboard (placeholder page for now)
DHOI → /dhoi-dashboard (placeholder page for now)
student → /student-dashboard (placeholder page for now)
parent → /parent-dashboard (placeholder page for now)

SuperAdmin login (hardcoded, no signup):

School Code: Zaroda001
Email: oduorongo@gmail.com
Password: ongo123
On successful login → redirect to /superadmin-dashboard

Teacher flow:

Has both a Sign Up and Login form
Sign up collects: full name, email, password, school code, subject, phone number
After sign up, save their details and auto-redirect to /teacher-dashboard
On future logins, validate email + password against saved details → redirect to /teacher-dashboard

Login page behavior:

Single login page for ALL roles
Has a role selector dropdown (SuperAdmin, HOI, DHOI, Teacher, Student, Parent)
When SuperAdmin is selected → show fields: School Code, Email, Password
When Teacher is selected → show a toggle between Login and Sign Up
When HOI, DHOI, Student, Parent are selected → show Login form only (just email + password) with a message "Contact your administrator to get your account" — no functionality yet
After successful login, store the user role and details in localStorage and React Context

Auth Context (src/context/AuthContext.tsx):

Create an AuthProvider that wraps the whole app
Exposes: currentUser, userRole, login(), logout(), signup()
On logout → clear localStorage and redirect to /login

Protected Routes:

Create a ProtectedRoute component that checks if user is logged in and has the correct role
If not logged in → redirect to /login
If logged in but wrong role → redirect back to their correct dashboard

File structure to create:

src/context/AuthContext.tsx
src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
src/pages/Login.tsx (update existing login page)
src/pages/HoiDashboard.tsx (placeholder)
src/pages/DhoiDashboard.tsx (placeholder)
src/pages/StudentDashboard.tsx (placeholder)
src/pages/ParentDashboard.tsx (placeholder)

App.tsx routing:

Wrap all routes with AuthProvider
Protect every dashboard route with ProtectedRoute + correct role
Default route / → redirect to /login

Use React Router v6, React Context API, localStorage. Keep the existing login page design and just wire up the logic. Make sure the login form gives clear error messages for wrong credentials.
