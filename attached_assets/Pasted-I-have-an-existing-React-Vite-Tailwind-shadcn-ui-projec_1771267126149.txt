I have an existing React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui project with SuperAdmin, HOI, DHOI, and Teacher dashboards already built. I need you to build a complete HOD (Head of Department) Dashboard and add it to my project. HOD is the Head of a specific subject department (e.g. Head of Mathematics Department, Head of Sciences, Head of Languages etc.)

IMPORTANT RULES BEFORE YOU START:

Read my App.tsx, AuthContext.tsx, and existing file structure first
Do NOT touch any existing dashboards
Do NOT change the auth system except to add HOD login support
HOD route /hod-dashboard must stay protected (only role=HOD can access)
Use same design: shadcn/ui, Tailwind, lucide-react icons
All data in localStorage using the same storage.ts utility already built
All forms validate and show errors
All add/edit actions open in modals
Tables paginate at 10 rows per page
Use recharts for all charts
HOD only sees data related to their own department — they cannot see other departments' data


HOW HOD ACCOUNT IS CREATED:

HOD does NOT sign up themselves
The DHOI (or HOI) creates the HOD account from inside their dashboard
Add a "Manage HODs" section inside both HOI and DHOI dashboards
To create HOD account, DHOI/HOI enters: Full Name, Email, Assigned Password, Phone, Employee ID, Department (select from existing subjects e.g. Mathematics, Sciences, Languages, Humanities, Technical), HOD Code (e.g. HOD001)
That account is saved to localStorage under key zaroda_hod_accounts (array, multiple HODs can exist)
When HOD goes to /login, selects role HOD, enters email + password → system checks against zaroda_hod_accounts → redirects to /hod-dashboard
HOD's department is stored in their account so the dashboard filters everything by their department
Update AuthContext to support HOD login and store HOD's department in the auth context


HOD LAYOUT:
Sidebar layout with top navbar. Show HOD name, HOD Code, and their Department name prominently in the navbar (e.g. "HOD - Mathematics Department"). Same visual style as other dashboards.

SIDEBAR SECTIONS:
1. Overview (Home)

Stats cards: Teachers in My Department, Subjects Under My Department, Total Students Taking My Subjects, Average Performance This Term, Lessons This Week
Department announcement board (HOD can post announcements visible to teachers in their dept)
Upcoming department activities/events
Quick action buttons: Add Lesson Note, Record Exam Results, View Timetable, View Teachers

2. Department Profile

View and edit department details (name, motto, description)
List of subjects under this department
HOD can add sub-subjects under their department (e.g. under Sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
Department goals for the term (add/edit/delete goals)
Department meeting schedule (add meeting date, agenda, minutes)
Department meeting minutes: record what was discussed, who attended, action points

3. Teachers in My Department

View all teachers assigned to this department (read from zaroda_teachers, filter by department)
Each teacher shown with: Teacher Code, Name, Subjects Teaching, Classes Assigned, Lessons Per Week
View individual teacher profile (read-only): their full schedule from master timetable, duties, subjects
HOD can write a teacher performance note (saved locally, visible only to HOD and that teacher)
HOD can mark a teacher as "observed" with observation date and feedback notes
Teacher Observation Form: HOD fills structured form — Lesson date, Class observed, Topic taught, Strengths, Areas to improve, Rating (1-5), Recommendations
View all observation records in a table

4. Subjects & Curriculum

View all subjects under this department with classes they're taught in
For each subject per class, HOD sets: Scheme of Work (topics per week for the whole term)
Scheme of Work builder: Term → Week → Topic → Subtopic → Learning Objectives → Teaching/Learning Activities → Resources Needed → Assessment Method
View scheme of work as a table (Week | Topic | Subtopic | Activities | Resources | Assessment)
HOD can mark each week's scheme as "Covered" or "Pending" or "Incomplete"
Save to zaroda_scheme_of_work

5. Lesson Notes & Resources

Teachers in the department can submit lesson notes (title, subject, class, week, content/description, file name)
HOD views all submitted lesson notes: filter by teacher, subject, class, week
HOD can approve or send back with comments
HOD can also upload department resources (name, description, subject, file name placeholder)
Save to zaroda_lesson_notes

6. Exams & Assessment
Exam Setup:

Create an exam (name e.g. "End Term 1 Exam", type: CAT/Mid-Term/End-Term, date, subjects included, classes)
Save to zaroda_exams

Results Entry:

Select exam → select subject → select class/stream → enter marks per student
Student list loaded from zaroda_students filtered by class
Enter: Student Name (auto-loaded), Admission No, Marks Out of (e.g. /100), Marks Scored
System auto-calculates: percentage, grade (A/B/C/D/E based on Kenyan grading), remarks (Excellent/Good/Average/Below Average/Fail)

Kenyan Grading Scale:

75-100: A (Excellent)
60-74: B (Good)
50-59: C (Average)
40-49: D (Below Average)
0-39: E (Fail)
